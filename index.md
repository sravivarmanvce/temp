## ICSGET 2025
<p align="justify">The 3<sup>rd</sup> International Conference on Sustainable Green Energy Technologies (ICSGET 2025) is conducted by the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Vardhaman College of Engineering, Hyderabad. The main aim of this international conference is to bring together researchers to facilitate knowledge sharing in emerging technologies and enhance collaboration world over. Along with researchers, the professionals and executives from energy sector, manufacturing industries, electrical power companies are invited to share their ideas and information pertaining to recent thrust areas of sustainable green energy technologies. The conference will enable the delegates to undertake collaborative research, update their technical knowledge and to stay in tune with recent advances. The technical program consists of keynote lectures, peer-reviewed paper presentations, panel discussions and presentations by industry professionals. It is envisaged that the conference will provide a platform where opportunities for national and international collaboration amongst top universities (from India and abroad) is plentiful.</p>

#### The Context
The major challenge is to bring the two groups together in a mutually beneficial way (the Students and the Community). It was specifically to address this challenge that the V-EPICS programme was launched. The V-EPICS programme connects engineering with community service in four verticals of community improvement effort as defined by EPICS in IEEE:


<div class="card2__wrap--outer">
        <div class="card2__wrap--inner">
            <div class="card2 colorgreen">
                <div class="card2__item colorgreen"><h5>Access and Abilities</h5></div>
					<div class="card2__item flexible colorgreen">By bringing together student branches at universities, secondary students and non-profit organizations, there is a greater ability to solve accessibility issues within communities. As students learn to help their community or country through engineering projects, non-profit organizations establish themselves in order to maintain new and profound change. The Access and Abilities projects help enable adaptive services, clinics for those in need (such as children with disabilities), me for adults and assistive technologies.</div>

					<div class="card2__item  flexible coloryellow">To help young students and to discover the benefits of science, math, technology and engineering for their future, many projects give students hands-on experience in order to stimulate their interests in those fields. Communities and schools lacking in strong engineering programmes gain new curriculum along with new facilities in which to explore new areas of the topic.</div>
