## Call for Papers

The ICSGET-2024 is a platform both for industry and academia to present and discuss the innovations, trends, and concerns as well as the challenges encountered and solutions. We invite researchers, professionals, and industry experts to to submit their original, unpublished research contributions to these tracks that are not currently under consideration by another conference/journal, and be part of a collaborative effort to shape a sustainable and eco-conscious energy future.

**Track 5: Advanced Energy Storage Solutions**
- Cutting-edge advancements in energy storage technologies
- Novel energy storage materials
- Efficient storage systems
- Innovative approaches to enhance reliability
- Integration of battery technologies, supercapacitors, and thermal energy storage into sustainable energy ecosystems

#### Tracks
The major challenge is to bring the two groups together in a mutually beneficial way (the Students and the Community). It was specifically to address this challenge that the V-EPICS programme was launched. The V-EPICS programme connects engineering with community service in four verticals of community improvement effort as defined by EPICS in IEEE:
