#### EPICS @ Vardhaman
<p align="justify">VCE - Engineering Projects in community Services (VISn @ V â€“ Viable Innovative Solutions for community needs at Vardhaman) is one of the best practices in Vardhaman Campus. EPICS is a unique programme in which teams of undergraduates design, build, and deploy real systems to solve engineering problems for local community service and educational organizations.The programme focuses on identifying the needs of the society and providing a viable and sustainable solution.</p>

#### The Context
The major challenge is to bring the two groups together in a mutually beneficial way (the Students and the Community). It was specifically to address this challenge that the V-EPICS programme was launched. The V-EPICS programme connects engineering with community service in four verticals of community improvement effort as defined by EPICS in IEEE:

                <div class="card2__item colorgreen"><h5>Access and Abilities</h5></div>
					<div class="card2__item flexible colorgreen">By bringing together student branches at universities, secondary students and non-profit organizations, there is a greater ability to solve accessibility issues within communities. As students learn to help their community or country through engineering projects, non-profit organizations establish themselves in order to maintain new and profound change. The Access and Abilities projects help enable adaptive services, clinics for those in need (such as children with disabilities), me for adults and assistive technologies.</div>

					<div class="card2__item  flexible coloryellow">To help young students and to discover the benefits of science, math, technology and engineering for their future, many projects give students hands-on experience in order to stimulate their interests in those fields. Communities and schools lacking in strong engineering programmes gain new curriculum along with new facilities in which to explore new areas of the topic.</div>
